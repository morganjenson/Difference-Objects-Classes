In object-oriented programming, a class is a template that contains certain defining characteristics. An object is a specific instance of that class. For example, cars would be considered a class, while the specific car that you drive would be an object. Because classes define the behavior of objects, you can have any number objects in a program with many differing characteristics, but they will all have the features of their respective class. For example, red cars and blue cars have different colors but they can both be driven. Classes and objects are often used by programmers to simulate real-life concepts. A typical java program creates many objects which interact through methods. Both classes and objects contain different components. A class in java can contain a data member (variable), a method, a constructor (method used to initialize objects), a nested class (class defined within another class), or an interface (specifies the behavior of the class using abstract methods). When a class is declared it can include components such as modifiers (like public or default access), a class keyword which can be used to create a class, class name, superclass, and constructors which are used for initializing new objects. All classes have at least one constructor. An object consists of three things. A state which reflects the properties of an object, its behavior which is represented by the methods, and its identity (unique name). Classes do not take up space in memory, but objects are given space in memory when they are created. Classes can also be declared as final, meaning that it can no longer be extended by a subclass. Java has a built-in class called Object which serves as the superclass for all other classes. Understanding the concepts of objects and classes helps software developers to write more efficient and reusable code.
